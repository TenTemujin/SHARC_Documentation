# Create a Propagation Model

---

## 1. Setup the Environment

### Directory Structure
1. **Navigate to the base directory of your project:**
   ```bash
   \sharc\propagation
   ```

2. **Create a new Python file for your propagation model:**  
   Use a descriptive and consistent naming convention such as `propagation_<model_name>.py`.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   propagation_custom_model.py
   ```

---

## 2. Define the Parameters

The propagation model will require several parameters to accurately model how signals travel through the environment. Below are the key parameters:

- **Frequency (f)**: Determines the wavelength and behavior of radio waves in different environments.
- **Transmitter Power (P_t)**: The output power of the transmitter, affecting the initial signal strength.
- **Antenna Heights (h_tx, h_rx)**: Heights of the transmitting and receiving antennas, which impact line-of-sight and diffraction.
- **Environmental Factors**: These include buildings, terrain, and vegetation that attenuate the signal.
- **Receiver Sensitivity (P_r)**: The minimum signal strength required by the receiver for successful communication.
- **Distance (d)**: The distance between the transmitter and receiver, which typically causes signal degradation.
- **Free-space Path Loss (FSPL)**: Attenuation in an ideal line-of-sight environment.
- **Atmospheric Loss**: Signal attenuation due to atmospheric conditions like water vapor and oxygen.
- **Clutter Loss**: Loss due to obstacles like buildings and trees.
- **Diffraction Loss**: Loss caused by the signal bending around large obstacles.
- **Multipath Loss/Fading**: Loss due to the signal traveling via multiple paths.

## 3. Choose the Propagation Model

You need to select an appropriate model based on the environment in which the signal will propagate. Common models include:

- **Free-space Model**: Assumes an ideal, unobstructed environment where radio waves travel in a straight line.
- **Hata Model**: Suitable for urban and suburban areas, accounting for various environmental factors like terrain and buildings.
- **Okumura Model**: Designed for urban environments with more detailed path loss data.
- **Cost-231 Model**: An extension of the Hata model for higher frequencies.
- **ITU-R P.1546**: Specifically used for predicting coverage in rural areas.

Each model comes with its own formula to calculate the path loss based on factors such as frequency, distance, and the environment.

## 4. Calculate Path Loss

The next step is to compute the path loss between the transmitter and receiver. Path loss refers to the decrease in signal strength as the signal propagates through the environment.

For example, using the **Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL)** formula:

```plaintext
FSPL(dB) = 20 * log10(d) + 20 * log10(f) + 20 * log10(4 * pi / c)
Where:
d is the distance between transmitter and receiver (meters).
f is the frequency (Hz).
c is the speed of light in a vacuum (~3 Ã— 10^8 m/s).
```

This formula computes the signal loss in an unobstructed environment. For more complex environments, like urban or rural areas, you can use models like Hata, Okumura, or Cost-231, which incorporate factors like terrain and building heights.

## 5. Code the Propagation Model

Here is an example implementation of a basic propagation model in Python. This model combines several loss factors to compute the total path loss.

```python
import numpy as np

class PropagationModel:
    def __init__(self, frequency, distance, altitude_tx, altitude_rx, terrain_type):
        self.frequency = frequency  # Frequency in Hz
        self.distance = distance  # Distance in meters
        self.altitude_tx = altitude_tx  # Transmitter altitude in meters
        self.altitude_rx = altitude_rx  # Receiver altitude in meters
        self.terrain_type = terrain_type  # Type of terrain (urban, rural, etc.)

    def free_space_loss(self):
        c = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s
        fspl = 20 * np.log10(self.distance) + 20 * np.log10(self.frequency) + 20 * np.log10(4 * np.pi / c)
        return fspl

    def atmospheric_loss(self):
        # Simplified atmospheric loss model
        return 2.0  # Example value in dB

    def clutter_loss(self):
        # Terrain-dependent clutter loss
        if self.terrain_type == "urban":
            return 10.0  # Urban clutter loss in dB
        else:
            return 5.0  # Rural clutter loss in dB

    def diffraction_loss(self):
        # Placeholder for diffraction loss based on obstacles
        return 1.0  # Example diffraction loss in dB

    def total_loss(self):
        # Calculate the total path loss considering all factors
        fspl = self.free_space_loss()
        atm_loss = self.atmospheric_loss()
        clutter_loss = self.clutter_loss()
        diff_loss = self.diffraction_loss()

        total_loss = fspl + atm_loss + clutter_loss + diff_loss
        return total_loss

# Example usage
model = PropagationModel(frequency=2.4e9, distance=1000, altitude_tx=100, altitude_rx=50, terrain_type="urban")
total_loss = model.total_loss()
print(f"Total Path Loss: {total_loss} dB")
```

This model includes several key loss factors: free-space loss, atmospheric loss, clutter loss (based on terrain type), and diffraction loss. It calculates the total loss by summing these components.

## 6. Test and Validate the Model

### Create a Test Script
To ensure the propagation model works as expected, create a test script to validate the model with various parameters and environments.

**Example Test Script:**
```python
model = PropagationModel(frequency=900e6, distance=5000, altitude_tx=150, altitude_rx=50, terrain_type="suburban")
total_loss = model.total_loss()
print(f"Total Path Loss: {total_loss} dB")
```

Run the script to check if the model produces realistic results. You can test the model with different frequencies, distances, and terrain types to evaluate its accuracy.
